**Solutions for modern C developers to create efficient and well-structured programs**

## What is this book about?
Practical C Programming will teach you how to deal with C and its idiosyncrasies, and benefit from its new features, through bite-sized recipes. Each recipe in the book addresses a specific problem through a discussion that reveals and explains the solution to the recipe. This book will teach all you need to know to become a better C programmer.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Discover how to use arrays, functions, and strings to create large apps
* Perform preprocessing and conditional compilation for efficient programming
* Understand how to use pointers and memory optimally
* Use general-purpose utilities and improve the performance of the code
* Implement multitasking using threads and process synchronization
* Explore low-level programming and inline assembly language
* Understand how to use graphics for animation
* Implement security while developing C programs
* Establish communication between two or more processes using different techniques

The code will look like the following:
```
for(i=0;i<2;i++)
  {
    for(j=0;j<4;j++)
    {
      matR[i][j]=0;
      for(k=0;k<3;k++)
      {
        matR[i][j]=matR[i][j]+matA[i][k]*matB[k][j];
      }
    }
  }
```
